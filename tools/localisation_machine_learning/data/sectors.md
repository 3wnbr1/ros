# Why sectors ?

The main problem of this localisation method is that for a global bach of data, severals positions can be computed with the same datas. To "solve" the problem, splitting the board into sectors is mandatory.

## Sector 1

x in [0.0, 1.5]
y in [1.0, 2.0]

## Sector 2

x in [0.0, 1.5]
y in [0.0, 1.0]

## Sector 3

x in [1.5, 3.0]
y in [0.0, 1.0]

## Sector 4

x in [1.5, 3.0]
y in [1.0, 2.0]
