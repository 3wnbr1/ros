### How to debug properly

#### Python

###### Interactive mode

Run your python script in interactive mode

```bash
python3 -i myscript.py
```

###### Segmentation Fault

In case you're getting nasty errors like

```
[INFO] [tree]: waiting for action server ... [NavigateToPose][FromConstant/Move]
[INFO] [tree]: ... connected to action server [NavigateToPose][FromConstant/Move]
Segmentation fault
```

Insert this snippet on top of you faulty script

```python
import faulthandler; faulthandler.enable()
```

Now run your script with

```bash
python3 -X faulthandler myscript.py
```

You now get a Stacktrace ðŸŽ‰
```
[INFO] [tree]: waiting for action server ... [NavigateToPose][FromConstant/Move]
[INFO] [tree]: ... connected to action server [NavigateToPose][FromConstant/Move]
Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault
